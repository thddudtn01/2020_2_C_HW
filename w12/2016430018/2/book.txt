Alice, a seven-year-old girl, is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister.
She notices a talking, clothed white rabbit with a pocket watch run past.
She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes.
She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden.
She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table.
She subsequently eats a cake labelled "EAT ME" in currants as the chapter closes.

The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling.
Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway.
Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a mouse, who is swimming as well.
Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French.
Her opening gambit "Où est ma chatte?" (transl. "Where is my cat?"), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.

The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters.
Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again.
Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on William the Conqueror.
A dodo decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner.
Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.
